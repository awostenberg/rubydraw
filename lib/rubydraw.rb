# Rubydraw is a high level game/graphics library, like Gosu or Rubygame, and is written completely
# in Ruby. Its only dependency is ruby-sdl-ffi, which it uses to access SDL functions. Also, thanks,
# Rubygame, for documenting your code (which, completely by coninsidence, also uses ruby-sdl-ffi),
# otherwise I wouldn't have the slightest idea on how to use the base library's undocumented code!
# You have been very helpful. :)
#
# NOTE: I can't get +ruby-sdl-ffi+ (the library Rubydraw uses to access SDL) to work with +Ruby
# 1.9.2,+ so I don't know if it even does. If it does work, and/or you know how to make it work,
# I would appreciate it if you notify me. So basically, I can't test anything with +1.9.2+. Sorry
# for the inconvenience!
