Rubydraw is a high level game/graphics library, like Gosu or Rubygame, and is written in Ruby.
Its only dependency is ruby-sdl-ffi, which it uses to access SDL functions.
–––––
NOTE: I can't get +ruby-sdl-ffi+ (the library Rubydraw uses to access SDL) to work with +Ruby
1.9.2+, so I don't know if it even does. If it does work, and/or you know how to make it work,
I would appreciate it if you notify me. So basically, I can't test anything with +1.9.2+. Sorry
for the inconvenience!

HOW TO INSTALL
To install this library which isn't on Rubygems.org YET, navigate to this directory in the command
line tool and give "rubydraw/build_and_install" permissions to run. Then simply run it. Hooray, it
should be working now! Test it in irb with "require 'rubydraw'".

HOW TO USE
There isn't a proper guide yet, so just read the comments in the other files. Or you can fire up the
gem server and read the RDoc.

Thanks for checking this little project. I hope it doesn't give you headaches.
Have fun!

NEW: Now you can install it from the RubyGems website! Hooray! :D
