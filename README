Rubydraw is a high level drawing/gaming library written in Ruby, like Gosu or Rubygame. Its only dependency is ruby-sdl-ffi, which it uses to access SDL functions.
-----
NOTE: ruby-sdl-ffi does NOT work with Ruby 1.9.2 (at least for me)! If you want to use Rubydraw, then you must use <= Ruby 1.8. Sorry!
